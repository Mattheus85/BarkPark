### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or
  embarrassed?**
    Use discord as a means of communication, it can be easier to talk through a chat application for some.
Always ask each other if they have any thoughts or opinions on a suggested idea. Always remain open
to new ideas and ask to explain more if it's not clear.

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
    Take a break if things get uncomfortable. If necessary, have a facilitator to talk separately to communicate
everyone comes to a mutual understanding. At worst case, contact a Lambda instructor and request for a group change. 

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
     Use a task tracking tool similar to Trullo. Have an organized scrum master that maintains
an accountability of tasks. Be sure to keep eyes on a scheduled timeline and that the team
is on track so as not to fall behind. If one is unable to finish a task, ask other team
members to support.

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
     As early as possible. Team members will support tasks that aren't finished on time.
Ensure there is no stigma for those who can't complete a task as some tasks are harder than others
and some individuals are better at certain things.

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
     Everyone keeps a same document that outlines how a finished product will look like.
Have discussions often so that the exchange of ideas are heard by every member. Daily code/work
review by team members once finished products are pushed to github.


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
    Get familiarized with the agile process. Learn to work as a team and apply the knowledge
that we've gained from previous units.


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
How to communicate with other team members. How to prioritize and delegate responsibilities.
Become comfortable with not owning the entire piece and relying on others to support a
single goal.


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
 Continue to improve our familiarity with AWS technology and how to integrate it
as part of the code. Get comfortable working in an agile environment.


* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals,
  complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
daily stand ups. Using Trullo. Offering constant support to complete the task.
